Simply install Python3

Then in Command Prompt type:

[path to pyhton interpreter]/python.exe 2Pass_loudnorm_v2.py

Alternatively, add the path to the Python Interpreter as an environment path in Windows, then you can just use 'python.exe' instead of the full path.

Remember to clear out the 'Out' folder before re-running with files of the same name in the 'In' folder (otherwise it gets stuck).
